			<center><ol>
				<li>Bar all ground-level doors (my house doors have slots to insert a metal bar to keep people out)</li>
				<li>Board up all windows (basement, main floor and upstairs)</li>
				<li>^ Board up basement door, as well (no bar slot, so easy target)</li>
				<li>Hold out with food and drinks stocked at the time</li>
				<li>Supplies would diminish in 2 or 3 days, so definitely scavenge (with a group)</li>
				<li>Hold out in house for however long the undead and other people let us</li>
				<li>If forced out of house, use only silent weapons and use stealth to remain undetected</li>
				<li>Keep on the go and find a new home hidden from general view, some place discrete</li>
				<li>Repeat steps when or if necessary</li>

				<h2>Possible Zombie Scenarios</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>The virus kills living people and brings them back, *possibly* allowing them to think somewhat normally</li>
					<li>The virus raises the already-dead from their graves, with people freaking out and trying to escape</li>
					<li>Depending on the transmition option(s) of the virus, survival may or may not be possible</li>
